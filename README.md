# Seq2seq demo

Seq2seq samples with 2 different frameworks:

- Tensorflow 1.2
- Pytorch 0.1.12

## Description
This toy has three different types:

### Input
- Type 1, 2: 8 random alphabets. Generated by generate.py.
- Type 3: 7 random consonants and 1 vowel in random order.

### Output
- Type 1: exactly the same as input
- Type 2: reverse of input
- Type 3: shift each alphabet by 1 position (i.e. A -> B, B -> C, etc..) If the shifted sequence contains any vowel, replace the character behind each vowel with the vowel in the input sequence. For example, if input is "ZBPOSDHV", the shifted string is "ACQPTEIW", and we should replace "C" and "I" with vowel "O", which appeared in the input sequence, so output should be "AOQPTEOW".

## Usage

Training data generator:
```python2 generator.py [type]```

Toy:
```python2 main.py [type]```
